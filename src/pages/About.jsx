        RentCircle is a rental-first fashion platform focused on menswear and
        womenswear. Inspired by premium fashion houses, we make high quality
        outfits accessible for weddings, shoots, office events and everyday
        outings.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Instead of buying outfits that you wear once and forget, you can rent
        them for a few days, get doorstep delivery, and return with ease. Less
        clutter in your wardrobe, less waste for the planet, and way more looks
        to play with.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Our curation is split across two simple categories – men's and women's
        clothing – so you can quickly find fits that match your vibe, size, and
        event type.
